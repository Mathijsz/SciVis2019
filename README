Real-time smoke simulation and visualization
============================================
This application was developed for the Scientific Visualization course at the University of Groningen.
It is based on a skeleton program that contained the smoke simulation logic and basic visualization.
The visualization part is improved upon, while the smoke simulation code is left mostly untouched.

Path (a):
- Color mapping
- Glyphs
- Divergence
- Isosurfaces
- Height plots
- Stream tubes (WIP)

Runtime requirements
====================
These requirements hold for the static builds delivered in this package.
The binaries carry a static build of Qt5, hence the large file size.

Windows version (Smoke.exe):
- Windows XP (32-bit) or newer

macOS version (Smoke.app):
- Sierra (10.12) or newer (older might work but untested)

Linux version (Smoke):
- A wide range of recent 64-bit distributions should be able to run the supplied binary.
    At least the following are known to work:
    * Debian 9.x
    * Ubuntu 16.04 (used on the LWP computers)
    * Ubuntu 18.04

For all platforms:
- Any renderer supporting OpenGL 1.x
    (Mesa software rendering on llvmpipe and the Apple Software Renderer also both work)


Building from source
====================

Dependencies:
- Qt 5.4 or newer (the static builds use 5.6.x and 5.12.x for Win/Linux and macOS respectively)
- Any C++ compiler (g++, MSVC, MinGW, Clang) that works with Qt

The easiest way to build is to open the project file Smoke.pro in Qt Creator and use the GUI to build.
Press CTRL+R to build and run.


Note: the dependency to GLU/GLUT libraries in the original code have been removed.

Note 2: the legacy FFTW-2.1.x library is a subproject within Smoke.pro, and thus will
    automatically be built and (statically) linked. There is no need to build it separately.
